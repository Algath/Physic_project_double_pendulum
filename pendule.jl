# Double pendulum simulation

This is a simulation of a double pendulum using Julia.

The objectif is too recreate a double pendulum simulation based on videos and to predict his mouvement during 2 seconds past the video end.
"""

md"""
## Theory
A double pendulum is also know as Chaotic pendulum because of its sensibility to initial conditions.

The particularity of this system is his behavior. It can vary from simple periodic motion to a more complex and chaotic one with a small change of initial angles or velocities.

## Parameters
- length of the first pendulum: L1 =  cm
- length of the second pendulum: L2 =  cm
- angles at t=0: θ1 = 181.5° = 3.159, θ2 = 183.1° = 3.194 (θ = 0° is the vertical down position)
